# value-cycle dev sample

This folder opens when you **Run Extension** (F5) so you can try the extension.

- **Run the command**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P`) → type **Cycle value** → choose "Cycle value (increment/decrement)".
- With no selection, the extension targets the value under the cursor or the first match on the line. Put the cursor on a value (e.g. `false`, `42`, `#ff8800`) and run the command to increment; run again to decrement.
- Add keybindings in Keyboard Shortcuts (e.g. `Ctrl+A` / `Ctrl+X`) if you want; the extension does not set defaults.
